## Overview
The IPL Winning Team Prediction Model uses machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of IPL matches. By analyzing various features from past IPL seasons, the model aims to provide accurate predictions for upcoming matches.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for IPL match data
- Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Predictive analysis and visualization of match outcomes
- User-friendly interface for prediction

## Installation
To get started with the IPL Winning Team Prediction Model, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipl-winning-team-prediction.git
cd ipl-winning-team-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installing the necessary dependencies, you can use the model to predict the outcome of an IPL match by running the following command:

```bash
python predict.py --team1 "Team A" --team2 "Team B" --venue "Stadium" --date "YYYY-MM-DD"
```

Example:

```bash
python predict.py --team1 "Mumbai Indians" --team2 "Chennai Super Kings" --venue "Wankhede Stadium" --date "2024-04-05"
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model includes historical IPL match data from previous seasons. The data includes information on:
- Teams
- Players
- Match venues
- Dates
- Match outcomes

The dataset can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Model Training
To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script will preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and save the best-performing model to the `models/` directory.

## Results
The performance of the trained models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results and comparison of different models can be found in the `results/` directory.
